## 📌 Steps Performed

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset: `data_set/country_wise_latest.csv`.
   - Cleaned the data and handled missing values.
   - Performed **feature engineering** for better predictions.

2️⃣ **Model Training**
   - Splitted the data into **training & testing sets**.
   - Used **(mention the ML algorithm: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)**.
   - Trained the model using **scikit-learn**.

3️⃣ **Model Evaluation**
   - Predicted outcomes on the test dataset.
   - Evaluated model performance using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision & Recall
     - Confusion Matrix
