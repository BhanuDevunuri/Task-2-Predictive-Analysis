Machine Learning Pipeline Project
📌 Project Overview
This project follows a 3-step pipeline:
1️⃣ Load and preprocess a dataset.
2️⃣ Train a machine learning model.
3️⃣ Evaluate the model's performance.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Execute the main script to run the full pipeline:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
🔹 What Happens When You Run main.py?
✅ Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
✅ Trains the machine learning model.
✅ Evaluates the model and displays results.

📦 Dependencies (Required Libraries)
These libraries are required (listed in requirements.txt):
✔ pandas – For handling and preprocessing data
✔ numpy – For numerical operations
✔ scikit-learn – For machine learning models

🔄 Project Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Data Preprocessing (preprocess.py)
➡ Loads the dataset
➡ Cleans and transforms the data

🔹 Step 2: Model Training (train_model.py)
➡ Trains a machine learning model
➡ Returns the trained model

🔹 Step 3: Model Evaluation (evaluate_model.py)
➡ Tests the model using test data
➡ Displays accuracy and performance metrics
